To accomplish the task of finding and deleting files with specific names in the current directory and its subdirectories, you can use the find command along with the -name and -delete options. Here's the command you can place in the "clean" file:

shell
Copy code
 $ find . \( -name '*~' -o -name '#*#' \) -print -delete
Let's break down the command:

find: Initiates the search for files.
.: Represents the current directory. You can replace it with a specific directory path if desired.
\( ... \): Encloses the expression for matching files. The backslashes \ are used to escape the parentheses for proper command line parsing.
-name '*~' -o -name '#*#': Specifies the conditions for matching files. The -name option is used to match the filenames. In this case, it looks for files ending with ~ or files that start and end with #.
-print: Displays the matched files.
-delete: Deletes the matched files.
Make sure to run this command with caution as it will permanently delete the files without any confirmation prompt. Also, ensure that you have appropriate permissions to delete the files.
